# Stats about Solar Cycle 24
Some simple Python Jupyter notebooks for getting and plotting stats about solar Cycle 24.

* Plot Sunspot number vs time: [sunspots.ipynb](https://github.com/ianan/cycle24/blob/master/sunspots.ipynb)
* HEK search for flares, then plot results: [hek flare search.ipynb](https://github.com/ianan/cycle24/blob/master/hek%20flare%20search.ipynb) and [hek flare plot.ipynb](https://github.com/ianan/cycle24/blob/master/hek%20flare%20plot.ipynb)
* Plot RHESSI flare latitudes: [rhessi flare lat.ipynb](https://github.com/ianan/cycle24/blob/master/rhessi%20flare%20lat.ipynb)
